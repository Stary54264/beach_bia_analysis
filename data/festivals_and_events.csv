It considers multiple layers of engagement with the land, including a history of land defense movements, medicine walks, and ancestral practices of prescribed burns, alongside contemporary art.

Experience what critics call a “devilish delight!” With fresh characters, familiar tales, and unique terrors, we bring literature’s most depraved characters to life… and death.

After a lady of the night is murdered, a mad doctor strikes a pact with the Devil to raise her from the dead. But when he comes face-to-face with her killer at a masquerade, all hell breaks loose. Descend into madness with Victor Frankenstein, Henry Jekyll, and Dorian Gray as they discover the consequences of playing God and the monstrous repercussions when the Devil comes to collect. 

An immersive horror opera set within the oldest surviving building from the Town of York, we invite you to explore Victorian Toronto through the eyes of history’s most disturbed authors, though it might just cost your soul.

Directed by Paul Bates (The Second City, Dan For Mayor), this show boasts an all-star lineup of Toronto’s funniest comedians, including Christy Bruce (Schitt’s Creek), Alastair Forbes (Join Canada, Eh!), Natalie Metcalfe (The Second City), Aurora Browne (Baroness Von Sketch Show), Jan Caruana (Because News), Sharjil Rasool (Run the Burbs), and Kris Siddiqi (The Boys). With technical wizardry by Seann Murray, this show is a comedic rollercoaster you won’t want to miss.

The outdoor installation, made from a suspended grid of copper leaves, reimagines the shelter of a forest canopy with each leaf individually cut and hung to form a floating canopy above. By day, the leaves catch the light and scatter soft shadows across the ground. By night, lighting transforms the installation, casting intricate patterns on surrounding surfaces and shifting the atmosphere of the space entirely. As wind moves through the piece, the leaves gently sway and rustle, adding a subtle layer of sound to the experience.

Visitors can enjoy the opulent holiday décor and period ambiance that once filled the home of the wealthy Austin family. Twinkling lights, antique ornaments, and rooms set for a classic Jazz Age celebration bring the spirit of the season to life.
As you stroll through the mansion, interpretive displays offer insights into the lavish holiday traditions of Toronto’s elite in the 1920s. In contrast, visitors will also learn about the experiences of the city’s less fortunate citizens during the same era—those who faced poverty, unemployment, and food insecurity during a time of great social and economic change.
From a grand dining room prepared for a festive feast to modest depictions of how the servants of the household marked the holidays, the experience paints a full picture of a Toronto Christmas in the early 20th century.

This Artist-in-Residence is held within Invitations to Better Worlds project and is a collaboration with the Department of Imaginary Affairs and Jane/Finch Centre.

Their album titles ""Harbour"" and ""Headland"", honor the meeting point between the land and sea and they sing songs about shorelines, seafarers and drownings. 

They revel in the driving danceability of Irish tunes, but also take inspiration from the pastoral melodies and naturalistic metaphors of Scottish music. But while the music they write is forged in tradition, it is nonetheless cast and tempered in new and unexpected ways.

Memory is a funny thing, so quiet if left undisturbed, beyond space and time.

Two love stories twist together in two Beiruts riven by time and conflict. In 1978, two women share spit on the ends of cigarettes and yearn for tenderness under the tumult of war. In 2018, a foreigner and a local flirt over vodka sodas as their contradictions collect like condensation on the sides of their glasses. 

Poetic realism braids past and present into the green line of vegetation that bisected the concrete of Lebanon’s capital during the civil war. Named a finalist for the 2024 Governor General's Literary Award, unearths queer history that has always been there, whether our ancestors wanted it to be inherited or erased.

By day, the leaves catch the light and scatter soft shadows across the ground. By night, lighting transforms the installation, casting intricate patterns on surrounding surfaces and shifting the atmosphere of the space entirely. As wind moves through the piece, the leaves gently sway and rustle, adding a subtle layer of sound to the experience.

Responding to its surroundings and shifting with the light, weather and movement of people passing beneath it, this work offers a dynamic and reflective space in the heart of the city.

Witness hope and resilience onstage in The Mush Hole – an exquisite theatrical dance performance that illuminates a dark corner of Canada’s history. From 1828 to 1970, Indigenous children from Six Nations were torn from their families, stripped of their names, and forced to live at Brantford’s Mohawk Institute Residential School. Kids called it the Mush Hole for the appalling gruel they were fed.

From visionary director, choreographer, and producer Santee Smith, comes this powerful story, created from the testimonials of two generations of survivors. With visceral performances from an all-Indigenous cast, immersive video, and a cinematic musical score, this five-time Dora Award-winner is one of Canada’s must-see productions.",NA,2025-10-11T14:00:00-04:00,2025-10-11T15:00:00-04:00,,,,The Mush Hole,NA,NA,NA,40.00,12.00,NA,NA,NA,NA,2025-10-11T14:00:00-04:00,Approved,,NA,NA,,https://www.youngpeoplestheatre.org/shows-tickets/the-mush-hole/,NA,No,No,704b8209-75f9-48db-a85e-58f7e3b9232a,NA,NA,NA,,No,"A Story of Hope and Finding Light in Dark Places.

It considers multiple layers of engagement with the land, including a history of land defense movements, medicine walks, and ancestral practices of prescribed burns, alongside contemporary art.

In this exhibition, Migwans shifts our understanding of earthwork to refer to a way of working, rather than the making of singular objects, reclaiming the art historical framing from an Indigenous perspective.

The outdoor installation, made from a suspended grid of copper leaves, reimagines the shelter of a forest canopy with each leaf individually cut and hung to form a floating canopy above. By day, the leaves catch the light and scatter soft shadows across the ground. By night, lighting transforms the installation, casting intricate patterns on surrounding surfaces and shifting the atmosphere of the space entirely. As wind moves through the piece, the leaves gently sway and rustle, adding a subtle layer of sound to the experience.

Responding to its surroundings and shifting with the light, weather and movement of people passing beneath it, this work offers a dynamic and reflective space in the heart of the city.

Visitors can enjoy the opulent holiday décor and period ambiance that once filled the home of the wealthy Austin family.

As you stroll through the mansion, interpretive displays offer insights into the lavish holiday traditions of Toronto’s elite in the 1920s. In contrast, visitors will also learn about the experiences of the city’s less fortunate citizens during the same era—those who faced poverty, unemployment, and food insecurity during a time of great social and economic change.
From a grand dining room prepared for a festive feast to modest depictions of how the servants of the household marked the holidays, the experience paints a full picture of a Toronto Christmas in the early 20th century.

Four parts to this adventure. First, ""Invasive Species"" - creatures that are motivated by a human-altered climate to move. Followed by ""My Resilient Garden"" - hope, maybe not for humans, but for the rest of the world to carry on. Next up, ""The Human Factor"" - we started this upheaval and we are now the victims. Can we do anything but squirm? Let’s hope. Ending with ""It’s About Time"" a playful reminder that time is running out.

Might be fun? Or not!

Four parts to this adventure. First, ""Invasive Species"" - creatures that are motivated by a human-altered climate to move. Followed by ""My Resilient Garden"" - hope, maybe not for humans, but for the rest of the world to carry on. Next up, ""The Human Factor"" - we started this upheaval and we are now the victims. Can we do anything but squirm? Let’s hope. Ending with ""It’s About Time"" a playful reminder that time is running out.

Visitors can enjoy the opulent holiday décor and period ambiance that once filled the home of the wealthy Austin family. Twinkling lights, antique ornaments, and rooms set for a classic Jazz Age celebration bring the spirit of the season to life.
As you stroll through the mansion, interpretive displays offer insights into the lavish holiday traditions of Toronto’s elite in the 1920s. In contrast, visitors will also learn about the experiences of the city’s less fortunate citizens during the same era—those who faced poverty, unemployment, and food insecurity during a time of great social and economic change.
From a grand dining room prepared for a festive feast to modest depictions of how the servants of the household marked the holidays, the experience paints a full picture of a Toronto Christmas in the early 20th century.

In her Canadian debut, Intergalactic Planetary brings together imagery and works inspired by cities including Shanghai, Chongqing, Berlin, Tokyo, Bangkok and locations across the United States. Snelling explains, “Through this work, I ask: how can we move beyond our fears, borders, and egos to become more humane? Perhaps by staying curious, open, and willing to see each other more fully, we can take a small step toward connection, and even a glimmer of peace for the future”.

Join us on Nuit Blanche to view the exhibition's works, while DJ beats set the mood with dynamic sounds and enjoy two exhibition-inspired cocktails-one coffee-based and the other with an intergalactic twist.

In her Canadian debut, Intergalactic Planetary brings together imagery and works inspired by cities including Shanghai, Chongqing, Berlin, Tokyo, Bangkok and locations across the United States. Snelling explains, “Through this work, I ask: how can we move beyond our fears, borders, and egos to become more humane? Perhaps by staying curious, open, and willing to see each other more fully, we can take a small step toward connection, and even a glimmer of peace for the future”.

Acclaimed author Ann McDougall will present a reading from her newly published book, A Ghost in the Room: Supernatural Adventures in Historic Houses, followed by an immersive exploration of historic techniques used in attempts to communicate with the dead  (both sincere and duplicitous).
Step inside the historic house as we uncover the Austin family's customs surrounding death and mourning, as well as the popularity of Spiritualism from mid 19th through the early 20th century. Guests will explore why the desire to communicate with the dead surged during the interwar period, and how grief and psychological trauma opened doors for both sincere belief and deception.
This event blends scholarly insight with Halloween thrill, debunking the myths while honoring the very human reasons we seek to connect with the beyond.

Violinist Mark Fewer and percussionist Aiyun Huang step into a surreal, poetic soundworld where time becomes a living presence. Through music, theatre, and light, the work asks: Can we ever be truly in sync with another person? What happens when our rhythms fall out of step? How do love and memory shape our sense of time?

Unfolding in a series of vivid scenes, each exploring a different human temporality, violin and percussion weave an artistic meditation on love, time, and the quest for harmony with the world.

At once abstract and deeply emotional, enjoy this one-of-a-kind performance experience.

Grammy Award-winning jazz pianist Brad Mehldau has recorded and performed extensively since the early 1990s. He is first and foremost an improviser and greatly cherishes the surprise and wonder that can occur from a spontaneous musical idea that is expressed directly, in real time. But he also has a deep fascination for the formal architecture of music, and it informs everything he plays. The two sides of Mehldau’s personality – the improviser and the formalist – play off each other, and the effect is often something like controlled chaos. 

Kirill Gerstein has established himself as one of today’s most prolific and compelling performers.

Perhaps by staying curious, open, and willing to see each other more fully, we can take a small step toward connection, and even a glimmer of peace for the future”.

Step into a world where time is stretched, fractured, and reassembled. Khumalo's compositions invite deep listening, where textures shimmer, dissolve, and reappear in unexpected ways.

 Drawing from African sonic traditions, European avant-garde, spectralism, and improvisatory jazz, Khumalo’s music resists easy categorization. In works like ""The Broken Mirrors of Time"", time is reflected in fragments, like memory, where cultural surfaces intersect, blur and transform. The piece echoes the vibrant simultaneity of downtown Johannesburg, where multiple musics resonate with one another. Expect music that is subtle yet powerful, abstract yet deeply rooted in the social, cultural, and sonic realities of African urban life.

“I’m an old man now, and I won’t be around much longer,” Wolf told him. “It’s up to you to carry it on.”

Linden still carries that frayed photograph in his wallet, along with a Sears 5/8” socket wrench in his pocket to play slide guitar. He has taken Wolf’s plea seriously, performing since he was 12 years old.

Memory is a funny thing, so quiet if left undisturbed, beyond space and time.

Two love stories twist together in two Beiruts riven by time and conflict. In 1978, two women share spit on the ends of cigarettes and yearn for tenderness under the tumult of war. In 2018, a foreigner and a local flirt over vodka sodas as their contradictions collect like condensation on the sides of their glasses. 

Poetic realism braids past and present into the green line of vegetation that bisected the concrete of Lebanon’s capital during the civil war. Named a finalist for the 2024 Governor General's Literary Award, unearths queer history that has always been there, whether our ancestors wanted it to be inherited or erased.

It considers multiple layers of engagement with the land, including a history of land defense movements, medicine walks, and ancestral practices of prescribed burns, alongside contemporary art.

This year’s line-up follows the rhythms of identity, from the pulsing beats of Afro-Antillean music to the quiet landscapes of childhood wonder to journeys across mountains, cities, and deserts in search of home and the intimate crossings of generations, friendships and dreams. 

In these films, rupture gives way to transformation, and every frame holds the promise of renewal. We honour voices that refuse to be silenced, visions that reshape reality, and connections that reach across borders. 

This is both a celebration and a reflection, a space where stories become bridges, and where watching together creates imagination and opens innovation.

As a ravine it is a storm water basin. This walk will review the details of how the ravine was chosen early on in the city's engagement with recovery of biodiversity in the Don Watershed, and how it is maintained as an environmentally significant area. Susan Aaron has been the volunteer team leader there for 20 years

The process of revitalization will be reviewed in detail. And the dissolution of private and public lands, for a shared forest, and the stability it brings to slopes and environment will also be dealt with. The ravine forest offsets and slows an urban heat island, stabilizes weather, and offers clean air.

Acclaimed author Ann McDougall will present a reading from her newly published book, A Ghost in the Room: Supernatural Adventures in Historic Houses, followed by an immersive exploration of historic techniques used in attempts to communicate with the dead  (both sincere and duplicitous).
Step inside the historic house as we uncover the Austin family's customs surrounding death and mourning, as well as the popularity of Spiritualism from mid 19th through the early 20th century. Guests will explore why the desire to communicate with the dead surged during the interwar period, and how grief and psychological trauma opened doors for both sincere belief and deception.
This event blends scholarly insight with Halloween thrill, debunking the myths while honoring the very human reasons we seek to connect with the beyond.

From the creators of the sold-out sensation, Tales of the Grotesque (2023 - 2024), comes a new anthology of gothic horror. Experience what critics call a “devilish delight!” With fresh characters, familiar tales, and unique terrors, we bring literature’s most depraved characters to life… and death.

After a lady of the night is murdered, a mad doctor strikes a pact with the Devil to raise her from the dead. But when he comes face-to-face with her killer at a masquerade, all hell breaks loose. Descend into madness with Victor Frankenstein, Henry Jekyll, and Dorian Gray as they discover the consequences of playing God and the monstrous repercussions when the Devil comes to collect. 

An immersive horror opera set within the oldest surviving building from the Town of York, we invite you to explore Victorian Toronto through the eyes of history’s most disturbed authors, though it might just cost your soul.

It’s a nod to global (or even galactic) unity, and to the idea that despite all the noise and division, we’re more alike than not. 

In her Canadian debut, Intergalactic Planetary brings together imagery and works inspired by cities including Shanghai, Chongqing, Berlin, Tokyo, Bangkok and locations across the United States. Snelling explains, “Through this work, I ask: how can we move beyond our fears, borders, and egos to become more humane? Perhaps by staying curious, open, and willing to see each other more fully, we can take a small step toward connection, and even a glimmer of peace for the future”.

Join us on Nuit Blanche to view the exhibition's works, while DJ beats set the mood with dynamic sounds and enjoy two exhibition-inspired cocktails-one coffee-based and the other with an intergalactic twist.

Daughter of the legendary fadista Teresa Siqueira, few artists have modernized fado as much as she has, combining reverence for the traditions of fado with a modern vision all her own. 

Her debut made waves in Portugal and worldwide, going platinum at home and earning rave reviews internationally. In Brazil, it opened doors to collaborations with legends like Milton Nascimento, Chico Buarque, and Nana Caymmi. 

Carminho has recently received attention for her appearance in Yorgos Lanthimos’s Oscar-winning film Poor Things, where she captivates Emma Stone’s character and the audience, bringing a fresh, modern twist to fado through her performance. More recently, she shared the stage with Coldplay and had the honour of performing for Pope Francis during World Youth Day in Lisbon.

Christine Donkin’s Three Autumn Scenes sets the stage with vivid, evocative imagery. 

Beethoven’s Leonore Overture No. 3, written for his only opera Fidelio, captures the emotional tension and ultimate triumph of freedom over oppression. 

Prokofiev’s Violin Concerto No. 1, performed by acclaimed Canadian violinist and our concertmaster Corey Gemmell, offers a striking contrast—dreamlike, lyrical, and unexpectedly delicate in its early 20th-century modernism. 

Strauss’s Tod und Verklärung (Death and Transfiguration) concludes the program, a sweeping tone poem that follows an artist’s final journey from mortality to metaphysical release.

Take in a moment of stillness, as we inviting visitors to stand beneath something that feels alive.

The outdoor installation, made from a suspended grid of copper leaves, reimagines the shelter of a forest canopy with each leaf individually cut and hung to form a floating canopy above. By day, the leaves catch the light and scatter soft shadows across the ground. By night, lighting transforms the installation, casting intricate patterns on surrounding surfaces and shifting the atmosphere of the space entirely.

Their 1986 debut album, produced by Canadian Peter Moore, was the blues-inspired ""Whites Off Earth Now!!"", recorded using an ambisonic microphone in the family garage.

The group’s fame spread with their second album, ""The Trinity Session"", recorded in 1987 at Toronto’s Church of the Holy Trinity. Their sound, again using the ambisonic microphone, and their mix of blues, country, folk, rock, and jazz earned them both critical attention and a cult following.

Perhaps by staying curious, open, and willing to see each other more fully, we can take a small step toward connection, and even a glimmer of peace for the future”.

Join us on Nuit Blanche to view the exhibition's works, while DJ beats set the mood with dynamic sounds and enjoy two exhibition-inspired cocktails-one coffee-based and the other with an intergalactic twist.

It considers multiple layers of engagement with the land, including a history of land defense movements, medicine walks, and ancestral practices of prescribed burns, alongside contemporary art.
